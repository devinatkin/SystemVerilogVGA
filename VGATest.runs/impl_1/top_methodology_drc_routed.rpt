2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen and clk_out1_vgaCLKgen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen_1 and clk_out1_vgaCLKgen are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_vgaCLKgen]
Related violations: <none>

The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/counter_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/counter_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/counter_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/counter_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/counter_reg[9]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Gen/vgaS/vsyncGenerator/pwm_out_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clkGen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_vgaCLKgen, clkfbout_vgaCLKgen_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clkGen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_vgaCLKgen, clk_out1_vgaCLKgen_1
Related violations: <none>
